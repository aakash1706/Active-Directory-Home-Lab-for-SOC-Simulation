# Active-Directory-Home-Lab-for-SOC-Simulation
This project builds a hands-on Active Directory environment using virtual machines to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, focusing on attack simulation and detection. It aligns perfectly with your transition to SOC analyst roles, demonstrating practical skills in SIEM querying and threat telemetry generation.
Objective
This project builds a free home lab simulating an enterprise Active Directory domain to practice SOC analyst skills. It focuses on generating attack telemetry via brute-force and MITRE ATT&CK techniques, then detecting them using Splunk SIEM queries for real-world threat hunting.

Skills Learned :

Proficiency in AD domain setup, networking, and VM configuration for cybersecurity labs.

Attack simulation (RDP brute-force, PowerShell persistence) and log generation (Event IDs 4624/4625).

Mastery of Splunk SIEM querying for threat detection and visibility gap analysis.

Practical application of MITRE ATT&CK framework with Atomic Red Team emulation.

Tools Used :

VirtualBox for multi-VM environment (Domain Controller, Windows target, Kali attacker).

Splunk SIEM for log ingestion, indexing, and detection queries.

Kali Linux with Crowbar for RDP brute-force attacks (RockYou wordlist).

Atomic Red Team for MITRE ATT&CK technique emulation.
